This paper aims to address the following main questions, typical of the beam distribution matching between a transfer line and a circular machine (e.g. the injection in the Large Hadron Collider),

1. Given an initial $\rho(x,p_x,...)$ at N=0 and the positio s_0 and a KAM topology at the same position s_0, find the $lim_N\rho_N$


2. Give a KAM topology and a beam profile (e.g. in 2D the x-profile or in 4D the x-y profile, etc), find the $\rho(x,p_x,...)$ that is matched.

3. When the $\rho$ is mathched in s_0, is it matched along the full circular machine? 

4. Is it $\rho$ constant but for an x-y-z metric factor along the machine? 

The first problem is a problem on analysis, the second one is a problem of synthesis. The 3 and 4 are corollaries of the 1 and 2.

To address this problem we assume that $\rho(x,p_x,...)$ is zero outside the first compact KAM region around the closed orbit.
Within this working hypothesis, the aforementioned limit exist if the system is non-linear, hence there is a natural.
